          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            We are a group of tech professionals working with schools to
            leverage technological solutions to enhance students' performance
            both inside and outside the classroom, with the help of teachers and
            parents.We have blended some of the most recent technologies to
            create a product that can make every activity more inclusive for
            every child in and out of the classroom.
            <br />
            Our goal is to improve and make every student more confident in
            their abilities because we believe every child is unique and has the
            potential to be the best if given the proper care, in our opinion.
            We think that if we can give school greater meaning, include parents
            who care, and create a unique plan for each child, they will succeed
            in their own unique way.
            <br />
            <br />
            In order to provide schools and students with more advanced
            information, link-Park also strives to increase school understanding
            and importance of ICT. Any student with internet access can use
            Link-resources Park's because one of its key goals is to make its
            services more accessible, we also want to work with schools to
            create programs that are suitable for each student.
