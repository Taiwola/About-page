          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            LinkPark is an edutech platform that is built to support the
            existing school system to bring out the best out of students.
            <br />
            At LinkPark, we believe that every student is special, the only
            reason why they struggle with their academics is the lack of special
            attention and support they need to become the star they are meant to
            be.
            <br />
            The physical school is is limited in bridging this gap because of
            its mass teaching method, and very minimal way of tracking student
            progress. However, with a fully digitalised system, students can be
            tracked, parents can be involved, and the gap can be bridged.
            <br />
            LinkPark is not a digital school, rather , it is a digital tool to
            help schools to help students.
            <br />
            LinkPark was founded in July, 2022, and headquartered at Akure, Ondo
            state. LinkPark team is led by Olanitori Tobi, a graduate of
            Computer Engineering from FUOYE, and a self taught Programmer.
            <br />
            <br />
            LinkPark unlike most other tech platforms is not a distruptive
            solution, but a supportive solution to digitalise your school
            experience and as a result simplify education for you.
